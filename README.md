# Personal Daily Dashboard - Capstone Project

## Goal

Using React and Transact SQL, create a single page web app dashboard for personal use which provides multiple relevant pieces of information about my day at a glance.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want the current weather displayed so that I know how to dress before leaving.
- As a user, I want to see the forecast for the next three days so that I know what weather to expect.
- As a user, I want the top news headlines shown to me so that I know what’s going on in the world.
- As a user, I want my upcoming calendar events for the day to be shown in a list on the page.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of tasks I’ve created so that I can keep track of my to-do items.
